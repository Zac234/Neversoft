                <p>
                    Neversoft was founded in July 1994 by three employees of Malibu Interactive (previously Acme
                    Interactive), a division of Malibu Comics based in Westlake Village, California.[1] At that time,
                    the primary platforms were the home gaming consoles, the Genesis/Mega Drive and the Super Nintendo
                    Entertainment System. Games for these systems could be developed by small teams, anywhere from two
                    to ten developers. As a result, it was much easier than at present to set up a game development
                    company, and several groups of people had already left Malibu to strike out on their own. Joel
                    Jewett, a native of Montana and a CPA, was at the time head of development at the rapidly shrinking
                    Malibu Interactive. He teamed up with Mick West, a game programmer, who had just completed working
                    on BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat for the Genesis, and Chris Ward, a video game artist.

                    
                    Neversoft was officially made defunct on July 10, 2014, 20 years to the day of its founding, with
                    the remaining employees attending a burning of a sculpture of the skewered eyeball from their logo
                    that has been part of their offices before.[5]
